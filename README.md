# Rename-Computer-and-add-ticket
 Renames the computer and optionally restarts it to take effect. The asset name will update in Syncro the next time Syncro syncs/refreshes the asset (which can take 12+ hours) so, it also creates a ticket with the old and new asset name for reference. Also, works with domain-joined computers. Credit to Isaac Good for the original script.
